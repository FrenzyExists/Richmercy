Lessons are made by Faisan [], one of the co-founders of Headstarter, who worked a lot in the data science and data engineering area. Now for the 1 or 2 cats in the neighborhood who's been stalking my Github knows that I've been doing data science for some time on my uni research, and this of course tickled my fancy.

Those 14 weeks will be interesting, really! I still have to update a few articles I have around, but I'll be writing my experience on each project, kinda to keep track of each.

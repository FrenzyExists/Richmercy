## About

This is my latest portfolio, built using Vue.js with Vite, incorporating several plugins to enhance development efficiency. The website includes features such as:

- **Markdown Parsing**: Easily render markdown content for dynamic pages.
- **Contact Form**: Send emails directly through the site for seamless communication.
- **Comment System**: Engage with visitors through a comment system that supports threaded replies.

If you have suggestions for additional features, feel free to open an issue and share your thoughts. Currently, the site encompasses all essential elements of a comprehensive portfolio.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on various devices, ensuring a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging Vite's capabilities for fast loading times and efficient bundling.
- **SEO Friendly**: Structured metadata and semantic HTML to improve search engine visibility.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Implementing best practices to make the website usable for all individuals.

## A bit of a backstory

This little project started as an exercise for me to learn and experiment with the Vue.js framework and see how it differs from React. As time went on I ended up putting myself goals as challenges, like markdown support, tho that would translate to a scavenger hunt for packages. Still, a challenge. I wanted to make something that I could maintain over time and evolve as I improve myself. And then I decided to turn this into my next and hopefully last porfolio website. I wanted to have full granular control of my website, and usually frameworks like Vue and React allow for such control, with the compromise of doing everything yourself. Fortunately, I'm the type who enjoys DIY.

About the vision I had of the website... it was NOT what it turned out to be like. I actually had to constantly change the colors, the structure, and the overall concept of what I wanted on my website over time. As a boss I worked used to say "Everything is a process".
